    En este ensayo, esbozo un análisis de la epistemología mapuche del saber-cómo desde la perspectiva de la epistemología analítica contemporánea. La observación y el testimonio aparecen como pilares de la adquisición de saber-cómo en el esquema epistemológico mapuche. La reconstrucción del esquema epistemológico mapuche que hago aquí muestra que la epistemología mapuche es similar en varios aspectos importantes a laasí-llamada epistemología de las virtudes.

    Así como es importante estudiar casos en que epistémicamente las cosas pasan bien, es necesario considerar casos en los que las cosas fallan. La epistemología de los vicios estudia la manera en que las personas son sujetas a distintos vicios de carácter no-moral, sino epistémico. En este ensayo, aplico esta idea al caso del saber-cómo, y describo cómo es que pueden existir vicios del saber-cómo, y en qué consistirían. Adicionalmente, considero el problema de determinar en qué condiciones es necesario ameliorar los vicios del saber-cómo.

    The concept of virtuosity plays a distinctive role in our understanding of performance arts, and of music in particular. In this paper we provide a new account of virtuosity as it applies to musical performers, performances, and pieces. According to this view, virtuosity has to do with the ability to overcome certain musical challenges, which involve sonic, interpretative/compositional and agentive components. We argue that this view improves on previous philosophical analyses by Mark (1980) and Howard (1997, 2008).

    In this paper, we aim to contribute to the growing literature on historical approaches to knowability by examining how the concept of knowability can be developed in the context of Peirce’s philosophy. There has been some previous work on Peirce’s notion of knowability (Dabay, 2016, and Chiffi & Pietarinen, 2020), but our analysis differs from these attempts. We argue that Peirce is committed to a version of the knowability thesis and thus liable to validate Fitch’s paradoxical argument, but that his overall epistemology offers a nuanced picture of the limits of knowledge.

  date: '2025'
  extra: '*Philosophical Psychology*'
  abstract: >
    In this paper, I examine the prospects of applying Rylean ideas about fiction to mental fictionalism. Arguably, Ryle was not himself a fictionalist about the mental. Nonetheless, some of his ideas seem to suggest an affinity with the position. I take this to be the result of his thinking about how to address ontological questions through the methodology of philosophical analysis. In particular, his early preoccupation with misleading expressions made him develop certain ideas that provide an account of fiction that should be of interest to fictionalists. Mental fictionalism needs to provide an account of fiction, and Ryle provides one. If we apply this account to the mental case, we get a kind of Rylean mental fictionalism that differs from Lycan’s (2022). Ryle’s early approach later developed into the logical cartography methodology that he applied in his rejection of the Cartesian picture of the mind in The Concept of Mind. Even if Ryle was close to a form of fictionalism in the thirties, by the late forties he had adopted a different approach to the mental. By tracing Ryle’s approach, we gain some insight into what differentiates Ryleanism from fictionalism.

    In this paper, we examine the prospect of extracting an account of know-how from Descartes’ philosophy. Against the traditional take, we argue that Descartes views on know-how cannot be simply reduced to his account of theoretical knowledge. The key to understanding Descartes on know-how is to examine his accounts of moral certainty and the relation between the mind and the body in action.

  abstract: > 
    In this paper, I consider the question of whether calibration is required for modalizing mechanisms to be reliable, that is, whether it is necessary for modalizing mechanisms to be adjusted to prevent overgeneration and undergeneration of modal beliefs. I first argue that the calibration requirement affects differently what I call bootstrapping and ordinary cases. Identifying different ways in which a modalizing mechanism could be calibrated, I argue that not all of them are effective or even viable in bootstrapping cases. Then, by taking a diachronic perspective, I offer a simplified account of how different calibration mechanisms can be bootstrapped, with an emphasis on the social dimension of modal judgment.

I argue that (despite some initial appearances) they are independent problems, which is specially important in the context of theories where know-how cannot in general be reduced to proposition-oriented attitudes.'

    This paper aims to connect  issues in the epistemology of modality with  issues in the philosophy of music, exploring how modalizing takes place in the context of musical performance. On the basis of studies of jazz improvisation and of classical music, it is shown that considerations about what is sonically, musically, and agentively possible play an important role for performers in the Western tonal tradition. We give a more systematic sketch  of how a modal epistemology for musical performance could be constructed. We argue that it is necessary to adopt a pluralist approach towards the modal epistemology of music.

  date: '2024'
  abstract: >
    Do we have control over the content of our imaginings? More precisely: do we have control over what our imaginings are about? Intentionalists say yes. Until recently, intentionalism could be taken as the received view. Recently, authors like Munro & Strohminger (2021) have developed some arguments against it. Here, I tentatively join their ranks and develop a new way to think about the way in which imaginings develop their contents that also goes against intentionalism. My proposal makes use of what we may call a ballistic framework for mental dynamics, which I sketch to some length. In this model, imaginings are articulated by ballistic events sensitive to constraints that modify the trajectories that imaginings trace in a special working space. This framework leaves room for alternatives to pre- assigned-content models, such as Kung’s (2016). In the ballistic-based models sketched here, and against intentionalism, imaginings can fail to be about what we intend them to be about. The framework also has applications beyond the intentionalism debate, some of which I will sketch.

    Stephenson (2022) has argued that Kant’s thesis that all transcendental truths are transcendentally a priori knowable leads to omniscience of all transcendental truths. His arguments depend on luminosity principles and closure principles for transcendental knowability. We will argue that one pair of a luminosity and a closure principle should not be used, because the closure principle is too strong, while the other pair of a luminosity and a closure principle should not be used, because the luminosity principle is too strong. Stephenson’s argument also depends on a factivity principle for transcendental knowability, which we will argue to be false.

    ¿Trae la posibilidad de mecanismos de mejoramiento cognitivo, como por ejemplo la posibilidad de implantar creencias en la mente de personas, preguntas nuevas a la epistemología? En este corto volumen, J. Adam Carter propone que sí. En particular, Carter argumenta que obliga a que consideremos la necesidad de una condición adicional en nuestras caracterizaciones del concepto de conocimiento: además de ser una forma de creencia verdadera justificada, que satisface una condición anti-Gettier, como aceptan la mayoría de los enfoques contemporáneos (en particular desde la perspectiva de la epistemología de las virtudes), el conocimiento debe satisfacer una condición de autonomía. En la práctica, esto significa que sujetos a quienes se haya implantado creencias que de otro modo satisfarían los estándares del conocimiento no tengan, por lo tanto, conocimiento, en contra de las predicciones de ciertos futuristas.

    The debate between intellectualists and anti-intellectualists about know-how rages on.

    Many philosophical discussions hinge on the concept of knowability. For example, there is a blooming literature on the so-called paradox of knowability. How to understand this notion, however? In this paper, we examine several approaches to the notion: the naive approach to take knowability as the possibility to know, the counterfactual approach endorsed by Edgington (1985) and Schlöder (2019), approaches based on the notion of a capacity or ability to know (Fara 2010, Humphreys 2011), and finally, approaches that make use of the resources of dynamic epistemic logic (van Benthem 2004, Holliday 2017).

    In this paper, I sketch a new model for the format of the content of understanding states, Compressible Graph Maximalism (CGM). In this model, the format of the content of understanding is graphical, and compressible.  It thus combines ideas from approaches that stress the link between understanding and holistic structure (like Grimm's (2016)), and approaches that emphasize the connection between understanding and compression (like Wilkenfeld's (2018)). I argue that the combination of these ideas has several attractive features, and I defend the idea against some challenges.

    In this paper, I raise the problem of dealing with counterpossible conditionals for theories of subject matter. I argue that existing accounts of subject matter need to be revised and extended to be able to a) provide reasonable (potentially non-degenerate) verdicts about what counterpossibles are about, b) explain the intuition that counterpossibles are in some sense about what would happen if the antecedent were true, and c) explain in what sense counterpossibles can be about individuals. I sketch how one could extend atom-based and way-based theories of subject matters to handle the problem. Then, I raise the problem that it might be desirable for a theory of subject matter to prevent the inference that certain counterpossibles are about the kinds of things that they seem to mention.

    Stephen Grimm defends the idea that for understanding people, we need to think of understanding not only in terms of grasp of structure (be that causal or of other kinds) but also in terms of a notion of understanding-as-taking-to-be-good.  In this paper, I critically examine this idea. First, I argue that in some cases, understanding-as-taking-to-be-good can be explained in terms of understanding-as-grasp-of-structure.  Then, I consider one further way in which understanding-as-taking-to-be-good could be obtained through something which is not a form of grasp of structure, which narrows and refines Grimm’s understanding-as-taking-to-be-good concept.

          Counterpossibles, counterfactuals conditional with impossible antecedents, are notoriously contested; while the standard view makes them trivially true, some authors argue that they can be non-trivially true. In this paper, I examine the use of counterfactuals in the context of games, and argue that there is a case to be made for their non-triviality in a restricted sense. In particular, I examine the case of retro problems in chess, where it can happen that one is tasked with evaluating counterfactuals about illegal positions. If we understand illegality as a type of restricted impossibility, those counterfactuals are non-trivial counterpossibles. I suggest that their non-triviality stems from their role in practices of rule coordination and revision, and suggest that this model could be generalized to counterpossibles in different domains. I then compare the approach to the accounts of Vetter 2016 and Locke 2019.

          I argue that modal epistemology should pay more attention to questions about the structure and function of modal thought. We can treat these questions from synchronic and diachronic angles. From a synchronic perspective, I consider whether a general argument for the epistemic support of modal though can be made on the basis of modal thoughs’s indispensability for what Enoch and Schechter (2008) call rationally required epistemic projects. After formulating the argument, I defend it from various objections. I also examine the possibility of considering the indispensability of modal thought in terms of its components. Finally, I argue that we also need to approach these issues from a diachronic perspective, and I sketch how to approach this task.
