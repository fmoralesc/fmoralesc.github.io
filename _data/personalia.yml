bio: |
  I am Doctor in
  Philosophy (received my degree at KU Leuven). My PhD thesis was on
  modal epistemology. More specifically, it gives an account of the
  structure of modal knowledge and of knowledge of so-called agentive
  modalities and abilities, with the background of knowledge of
  counterfactuals.
