- title: 'One More Against Finding the Source of Modal Spaces'
  abstract: >
    In this paper, I examine the question of the source of modal spaces. I identify two ways in which we could approach the question: internally and externally. I argue that internal approaches have to avoid the worry of vicious circularity, but that it will be hard for any account to satisfy this requirement. Introducing the notion of a modal profile, I show that many candidate explanatory bases may already be modally-profiled in a way that would make explanations invoking them circular. I examine the possibility that the circularity in these cases may not be vicious, but dismiss it. I then argue that external approaches might not do much better.
