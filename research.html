		<h2>PhD Thesis: Agentive Modality and the Structure of Modal Knowledge</h2>
		<p>This thesis develops a theory about the structure of modal judgment and
		knowledge. Arguing in favor of pluralism about the source of modal knowledge,
		it focuses on the questions of the varieties of modal judgement and their
		relations, the function of modal judgement and the scope of modal knowledge. It
		offers a hypothesis about the development of the framework of modal knowledge,
		grounding it on the capacity to evaluate temporal judgements, from which the
		capacity to evaluate alternatives comes from. It suggests that the most basic
		framework of modal judgements consists in that of agentive modality, and in
		particular, about what one can do, and how. It is argued
		that the rest of the framework of modal judgement can be developed on this
		basis, although this imposes certain restrictions about the scope of modal
		knowledge. Additionally, the thesis provides analyses of various agentive modal
		notions, such as imaginability, what is a way to do something, and discusses
		how to understand counterfactuals with impossible antecedents.</p>

			<div class="abstract">Counterpossibles, counterfactuals conditional with impossible antecedents, are notoriously contested; while the standard view makes them trivially true, some authors argue that they can be non-trivially true. In this paper, I examine the use of counterfactuals in the context of games, and argue that there is a case to be made for their non-triviality in a restricted sense. In particular, I examine the case of retro problems in chess, where it can happen that one is tasked with evaluating counterfactuals about illegal positions. If we understand illegality as a type of restricted impossibility, those counterfactuals are non-trivial counterpossibles. I suggest that their non-triviality stems from their role in practices of rule coordination and revision, and suggest that this model could be generalized to counterpossibles in different domains. I then compare the approach to the accounts of Vetter 2016 and Locke 2019.</div>

			<div class="abstract">I argue that modal epistemology should pay more attention to questions about the structure and function of modal thought. We can treat these questions from synchronic and diachronic angles. From a synchronic perspective, I consider whether a general argument for the epistemic support of modal though can be made on the basis of modal thoughs’s indispensability for what Enoch and Schechter (2008) call rationally required epistemic projects. After formulating the argument, I defend it from various objections. I also examine the possibility of considering the indispensability of modal thought in terms of its components. Finally, I argue that we also need to approach these issues from a diachronic perspective, and I sketch how to approach this task.</div>

			<div class="abstract">The final chapter of Elgin’s (True enough, The MIT Press, Cambridge, 2017) defends the claim that some mistakes mark significant epistemic achievements. Here, I extend Elgin’s analysis of the informativeness of mistakes for epistemic policing. I also examine the type of theory of competence that Elgin’s view requires, and suggest some directions in which this can be taken.</div>

			<div class="abstract">Loughlin’s (2018) uses Wittgenstein’s remarks in Philsophical Investigations to motivate his ‘wide’ view of cognition. In opposition to other accounts of extended cognition, his view presents a negative solution to the location problem. Here, I argue that, if we consider Wittgenstein’s remarks on the notion of ability, the support for the wide view is not as straightforward. The criteria for using the concept of ability are highly context-dependent, and there is not a single account for them. This shows that at best, a moderate form of anti-individualism for cognitive capacities can be defended on Wittgensteinian grounds. Furthermore, the suggestion that ontological questions can be bypassed is questioned. </div>

				<div class="abstract">In this short piece I advance the idea that philosophy is similar to daydreaming to a certain level of abstraction, and I suggest that we should work on the construction of logics that can model some of the features of daydreaming.</div>
