<div id="short-bio">
	<p>I am a philosopher. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at
	Universidad de Chile. Originally from Santiago (Chile), I pursued my PhD at
	KU Leuven's <a href="https://hiw.kuleuven.be/en/">Institute of
	Philosophy</a> (Belgium), where I also did my MPhil.  I mainly work in
	topics related to (i) the philosophy of modality, in special its epistemology and
	metaphysics, (ii) understanding, and (iii) know-how. I also am competent in
	general epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of logic and
	philosophical logic, and philosophy of language. I am also interested in a
	broad range of topics, from ancient skepticism, to the philosophy of
	mathematics, passing through the philosophy of music and visual arts,
	Wittgenstein, hypertext and design.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I draw, play guitar and contribute to various open source projects.</p>
