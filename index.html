<div id="short-bio">
    <p>I am a philosopher. Originally from Santiago (Chile), I pursued my PhD at KU Leuven's
    <a href="https://hiw.kuleuven.be/en/">Institute of Philosophy</a> (Belgium),
    where I also did my MPhil.  I mainly work in topics related to the philosophy of
    modality, in special its epistemology and metaphysics, but I also
    am competent in general epistemology, philosophy of science,
    philosophy of logic and philosophical logic, and philosophy of
    language. I am also interested in a broad range of topics, from
    ancient skepticism, to the philosophy of mathematics, passing through
    the philosophy of music and visual arts, Wittgenstein, hypertext and design.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I draw, play guitar and contribute to various open source projects.</p>
