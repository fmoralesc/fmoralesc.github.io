		    <p>I am a philosopher. Currently I am pursuing a PhD at the
		    <a href="https://hiw.kuleuven.be/en/">Institute of
		    Philosophy at KU Leuven</a> (Belgium), where I also did my
		    MPhil.  I mainly work in topics related to the philosophy of
		    modality, in special its epistemology and metaphysics, but I also
		    am competent in general epistemology, philosophy of science,
		    philosophy of logic and philosophical logic, and philosophy of
		    language. I am also interested in a broad range of topics, from
		    ancient skepticism, to the philosophy of mathematics, passing through
		    the philosophy of music and visual arts, Wittgenstein, hypertext and design.
		    Originally from Santiago (Chile), my studies are funded
		    by CONICYT's Beca Chile for Doctoral Studies Abroad.</p>
		    <p>In my spare time, I draw, play guitar and contribute to various open source projects.</p>
		    <p>You can find my CV <a href="cv.html">here</a>. Below you can find a

		<h2>Research</h2>

		<h3>PhD project: The epistemology of counterfactuals and modality</h3>
		<p>The topic of my PhD research is the epistemology of
		modality, that is, the study of knowledge (and more broadly,
		justified belief) about what is possible, necessary, impossible
		and contingent. Interest in the field comes from its relevance
		for the methodology of philosophy itself, where modal claims
		are often used as premises in arguments or as presuppositions.
		For example, this happens in the development of thought
		experiments. Accordingly, the focus has been on knowledge of
		non-actual metaphysical (non-ordinary, substantive)
		possibility. A recent approach to this question, explored by
		Williamson (2007) and Vetter (2016), tries to give an account
		of knowledge of metaphysical modality in terms of
		generalizations from ordinary 'entry-points'. Williamson
		stresses the role of imagination in the assessment of ordinary
		counterfactuals, and explains knowledge of metaphysical
		modality as a limiting case of the former. Vetter replaces
		knowledge of counterfactuals with knowledge of capacities and
		abilities, and explains knowledge of metaphysical modality in
		terms of a process of abstraction from concrete cases. In this
		research, I examine the general viability of this strategy, and
		independently explore the epistemological, logical, and
		metaphysical issues concerning knowledge of counterfactuals,
		abilities, and other related classes of judgment.
