		<div id="short-bio">
		    <p>I am a philosopher. Currently I am pursuing a PhD at the
		    <a href="https://hiw.kuleuven.be/en/">Institute of Philosophy at KU Leuven</a> (Belgium),
		    where I also did my MPHil.
		    I mainly work in topics related to the philosophy of modality, in special
		    its epistemology and metaphysics, but I also am interested in general epistemology, philosophy of science,
		    philosophy of logic and philosophical logic, and philosophy of language. Originally from
		    Santiago (Chile), my studies are funded by CONICYT's Beca Chile for Doctoral Studies Abroad.</p>
		    <p>You can find my CV <a href="cv.html">here</a>.</p>
