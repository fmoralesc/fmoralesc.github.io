*Philosophical Investigations*, 22.

> We might very well also write every assertion in the form of a 
question followed by an affirmative expression; for instance, “Is
it raining? Yes!” Would this show that every assertion contained a
question?

No, but it would show that the game of asserting is played in a language that 
also contains a game of questions. To understand this language you need to 
understand a language where you can ask questions (is the version of that where 
only questions can be made a possible language?), as well as a language where 
you can only produce expressions that in *our* language can serve as answers, 
and that in *this* language can only be put after a question.

If you think about how a language with these two components could come to 
exist, you have to recognize that questions and answers are in reality part of 
a more complex game, and not standalone parts of a language.
